## Research Question
The larger context of the project is Music Psychology. What the project aims to bring evidence about, is whether the performance in driving is affected by the presence of familiar music. A possible outcome would be that as participants hear music with familiar lyrics, they get more distracted, and therefore have a longer reaction time to avoid hazards (as some studies had already shown). Nonetheless, our project would analyze if that implication keeps on being valid while exploring diverse cultures.

## Literature
In the Oxford Handbook of Music Psychology, there is a special section dedicated to the decision of listening to music while driving a car. As state of the art, among​ others, are presented: 
* Brodsky, W. and Slor, Z. (2013). Background music as a risk factor for distraction among
young-novice drivers. Accident Analysis & Prevention, 59, 382–393.
* Cummings, R., Kopesell, T.D., Moffat, J.M. and Rivara, F.P. (2001). Drowsiness, counter-measures
to drowsiness, and the risk of a motor vehicle crash. Injury Prevention, 7, 194–199.
* Ünal, A.B., Steg, L. and Epstude, K. (2012).  e influence of music on mental e ort and driving performance. Accident Analysis and Prevention, 48, 271–278.

In Cummings, Koepsell, Moffat, and Rivara (2001), the real scenario is studied (United States):
As participants in the studies, there were geographically localized drivers in crashes due to deconcentration. The control participants were drivers that the next week, on the same day of the accident, passed for the same road.  
The researchers ask for exposures before the accident (sleep conditions, caffeine, and alcohol consumption, state of street and vehicle, trip historic, music exposure), gender, age, spoken language, and the city of registration of the vehicle.

In Ünal, Steg, and Epstude (2012), a simulated scenario is studied (Netherlands):
As participants in the studies, there were students with a valid driver license.   
The study inquiries for the effect of familiar-music vs no-music, while driving (specifically for the mental effort involved). So, their study includes questions about participants enjoyment of listening to the music, if the music was similar to what they usually listen to while driving if they did not find the music boring and a rating scale on the mental effort. 
The researchers ask for age, gender, driving experience, annual km drove and hearing deficiencies. 
They take care that the sound level of the music in the simulated scenario was approximately constant (90dBA).

In Brodsky and Slor (2012), a on-site research is carried on (Israel):
As participants in the studies, there were young-novice drivers with a valid driver’s license.
The researchers ask for gender, age, ethnic background, socioeconomic level, whether the participant had been prosecuted by a traffic court or a collision.
As part of the experiment, researchers measured the driver deficiency and vehicle performance.
Music related questions were how often they listen to music while driving, at which volume and what kind of music style.
Is important to notice that, in the experiment, the researchers used an alternative music background designed by Bordsky and Kizner (2012), specifically for increased driver safety.
For taking care of individual differences, each participant completed the Impulsivity and Sensation-Seeking Scale (which classify participants in four categories: thrill and adventure seeking, disinhibition, experience seeking and boredom), and according to the performance of the experiment, the participant was assigned to a driver profile (cautious, moderate, aggressive).

The present project supplements the issue of familiar music background impact on driving performance, by giving an intercultural approach. It would be interesting to understand if the impact of familiar music on driving, behaves differently from one culture to another. A sample of citizens in Iran, Colombia and United States is expected to be included.

## Methods

Having into account the methods presented in previous studies on the topic, like (Cummings, Koepsell, Moffat and Rivara, 2001), (Ünal, Steg, and Epstude,2012) and (Brodsky and Slor, 2013), there were selected common variables that seems to alter the way music affects the performance of driving a car, and summed up together in the following questionnaire.

### Prerequisite:
* Have you a driver license?
* Do you have any hearing deficiency?

### During experiment:
Users are asked to play a game.

sample : [Car driving](https://codeincomplete.com/games/racer/v4-final/)

Calculate score(according to frequency and severity of the violation of speeding, acceleration, braking, turning, RPMs) 

### Post experiment test:
1. PART 1:
* How old are you?
* Where are you from?
* Which is your gender?
* How many years of experience driving car do you have?
* Hours since last sleep?
* * Less than 6
* * 6-11
* * 12-17
* * More or equal to 18
* In the last 2 hours before the experiment, have you drunk caffeine beverages 
* Are you experienced in-car video games?
2. PART 2:
* Did you enjoy listening to the first song played?
* Did you enjoy listening to the second song played?
* Did you enjoy listening to the third song played?
* Was any of the songs played similar to what you usually listen to while driving?
* Did you find the music boring?

3. PART 3:
* [Music background based on Goldsmith’s Music Sophistication Index (Gold-MSI)](https://www.gold.ac.uk/music-mind-brain/gold-msi/).

4. PART 4:
* [Sensation Seeking Scale Questionnaire](http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/html.cfm/index86974EN.html ) (if focused on young people).
* [Personality test](https://discovermyprofile.com/miniIPIP/introduction.html)


## Data Gathering
The group will gather data by testing reaction time using a self-made game. The game consists of a user driving on the street. The user needs to make a certain reaction (eg. pressing a button) when something or someone gets into the driver’s way. 
There are going to be three levels of the game. Each level is accompanied by different musical performance that the user hears. The first level, there is music performed without lyrics. The second level, the user will hear a musical piece that has lyrics of the user’s mother tongue. And the third level, the user will hear music with lyrics not understood by the user. We will choose songs in Russian language in this case. The levels are randomly assigned so this way, as to avoid biases. This way, the bias that the user performs “better” on the next level, because he was already predisposed of a certain musical piece can be reduced. 

After the game, the user will have to fill out a questionnaire answering questions such as whether the user enjoyed the songs performed. This would allow us to see if emotions were involved when listening to the musical piece, which could also have correlation with the reaction time. 

The following musical pieces are considered:

Foreign language that is not recognized by user:

## Preprocessing
What the group is essentially testing for is if users react to obstacles differently depending on whether they hear music they are familiar with, versus the other levels. For instance, if the user hears lyrics that he or she is not familiar with, is the user more distracted because it is trying to analyze the lyrics and hence has a longer reaction time for obstacles? 
Given that our variable is the lyrics, we have to assume that the music has no affect on the reaction time. We chose Pop music as musical performance, because it is heard most frequently and hence our cognitive system is already pre-disposed to such melodic pieces – meaning that not much distraction is introduced when playing the song. However, when a popular song arises with lyrics and the user starts singing to the song, then there might be some distraction present. We would like to test if such distraction affects reaction time. Same goes with pop music with foreign lyrics.

## Basic Statistics
This test is going to be done over 180 persons (at least 60 persons per locale)

## Subsequent steps
The next steps are to start testing the game with users and gather the results of their reaction time as well as the questionnaire. We would then start analyzing the effects of different levels on the reaction time. The questionnaire would also give us additional information on whether there were other variables involved that could have affected the user’s reaction time. In this case, we would have to normalize the research so to reduce “outside noise” that could affect reaction time apart from our variable.
Alternatively, if the questionnaire shows an external variable that the user paid attention to and hence affected the reaction time, our group might reconsider changing our variable.
