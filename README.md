## Research Question
The larger context of the project is Music Psychology. What the project aims to bring evidence about, is whether the performance in driving is affected by the presence of familiar music. A possible outcome would be that as participants hear music with familiar lyrics, they get more distracted, and therefore have a longer reaction time to avoid hazards (as some studies had already shown). Nonetheless, our project would analyze if that implication keeps on being valid while exploring diverse cultures.

## Literature
In the Oxford Handbook of Music Psychology, there is a special section dedicated to the decision of listening to music while driving a car. As state of the art, among​ others, are presented: 
* Brodsky, W. and Slor, Z. (2013). Background music as a risk factor for distraction among
young-novice drivers. Accident Analysis & Prevention, 59, 382–393.
* Cummings, R., Kopesell, T.D., Moffat, J.M. and Rivara, F.P. (2001). Drowsiness, counter-measures
to drowsiness, and the risk of a motor vehicle crash. Injury Prevention, 7, 194–199.
* Ünal, A.B., Steg, L. and Epstude, K. (2012).  e influence of music on mental e ort and driving performance. Accident Analysis and Prevention, 48, 271–278.

In Cummings, Koepsell, Moffat, and Rivara (2001), the real scenario is studied (United States):
As participants in the studies, there were geographically localized drivers in crashes due to deconcentration. The control participants were drivers that the next week, on the same day of the accident, passed for the same road.  
The researchers ask for exposures before the accident (sleep conditions, caffeine, and alcohol consumption, state of street and vehicle, trip historic, music exposure), gender, age, spoken language, and the city of registration of the vehicle.

In Ünal, Steg, and Epstude (2012), a simulated scenario is studied (Netherlands):
As participants in the studies, there were students with a valid driver license.   
The study inquiries for the effect of familiar-music vs no-music, while driving (specifically for the mental effort involved). So, their study includes questions about participants enjoyment of listening to the music, if the music was similar to what they usually listen to while driving if they did not find the music boring and a rating scale on the mental effort. 
The researchers ask for age, gender, driving experience, annual km drove and hearing deficiencies. 
They take care that the sound level of the music in the simulated scenario was approximately constant (90dBA).

In Brodsky and Slor (2012), a on-site research is carried on (Israel):
As participants in the studies, there were young-novice drivers with a valid driver’s license.
The researchers ask for gender, age, ethnic background, socioeconomic level, whether the participant had been prosecuted by a traffic court or a collision.
As part of the experiment, researchers measured the driver deficiency and vehicle performance.
Music related questions were how often they listen to music while driving, at which volume and what kind of music style.
Is important to notice that, in the experiment, the researchers used an alternative music background designed by Bordsky and Kizner (2012), specifically for increased driver safety.
For taking care of individual differences, each participant completed the Impulsivity and Sensation-Seeking Scale (which classify participants in four categories: thrill and adventure seeking, disinhibition, experience seeking and boredom), and according to the performance of the experiment, the participant was assigned to a driver profile (cautious, moderate, aggressive).

The present project supplements the issue of familiar music background impact on driving performance, by giving an intercultural approach. It would be interesting to understand if the impact of familiar music on driving, behaves differently from one culture to another. A sample of citizens in Iran, Colombia and United States is expected to be included.

## Methods

Having into account the methods presented in previous studies on the topic, like (Cummings, Koepsell, Moffat and Rivara, 2001), (Ünal, Steg, and Epstude,2012) and (Brodsky and Slor, 2013), there were selected common variables that seems to alter the way music affects the performance of driving a car, and summed up together in the following questionnaire.

### During experiment:
Users are asked to play a game.

## Data Gathering
The group will gather data by testing reaction time using a self-made game. The game consists of a user driving on the street. The user needs to make a certain reaction (eg. pressing a button) when something or someone gets into the driver’s way. 
There are going to be three levels of the game. Each level is accompanied by different musical performance that the user hears. The first level, there is music performed without lyrics. The second level, the user will hear a musical piece that has lyrics of the user’s mother tongue. And the third level, the user will hear music with lyrics not understood by the user. We will choose songs in Russian language in this case. The levels are randomly assigned so this way, as to avoid biases. This way, the bias that the user performs “better” on the next level, because he was already predisposed of a certain musical piece can be reduced. 

After the game, the user will have to fill out a questionnaire answering questions such as whether the user enjoyed the songs performed. This would allow us to see if emotions were involved when listening to the musical piece, which could also have correlation with the reaction time. 

The following musical pieces are considered:

## Preprocessing
What the group is essentially testing for is if users react to obstacles differently depending on whether they hear music they are familiar with, versus the other levels. For instance, if the user hears lyrics that he or she is not familiar with, is the user more distracted because it is trying to analyze the lyrics and hence has a longer reaction time for obstacles? 
Given that our variable is the lyrics, we have to assume that the music has no affect on the reaction time. We chose Pop music as musical performance, because it is heard most frequently and hence our cognitive system is already pre-disposed to such melodic pieces – meaning that not much distraction is introduced when playing the song. However, when a popular song arises with lyrics and the user starts singing to the song, then there might be some distraction present. We would like to test if such distraction affects reaction time. Same goes with pop music with foreign lyrics.

# Designing experiment

## Choosing pieces of music

One of the most important phases of this project was choosing music. The best state was to have the same song in different languages(Spanish, French, Persian, and Russian) to avoid all problems which might be made by having different kinds of music.
The Christian song was chosen at first. But as the rhythm of music is not proper for driving or even playing it was rejected.
Then 10 pop songs were proposed for each language. A subset of these 40 songs was selected which did not have satisfying similarity. [Proposed pop songs](https://github.com/MrymZakani/DigitalMusicology/wiki/Initial-proposed-songs---Pop)

Final approach was to determine specific characteristics of music. The proposed characteristics were:
* key: C minor
* bpm: 130 to 150
* popularity: low
* energy: high

25 songs with above characteristics were proposed, at least 5 for each language. 
[Proposed songs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qz_LF2uI0vfYkL3sI0eODyVgxl7ThnisyD1CJHYM4Pk/edit?usp=sharing)

Music' features were extracted from [this website](http://www.songkeybpm.com/Advanced)

Based on BPM, Popularity, Energy, Dance-ability, Happiness, Loudness, Acousticness and most important factor human recognition most similar songs were chosen. The music with no lyrics was found based on other music.

## user experiment procedure

### Requirements

* 1 laptop to let interviewee play game and fill the form
* 1 headphone or hands-free

### Preparation
* A sequence of background music is prepared for each user.

* Users should know how to play the game to avoid learning process during the experiment which makes errors in results. If they do not know the game they will have time to play and learn before starting the experiment.


### Process
1. Users are asked to play following the game for 10 minutes:
[Car driving game](https://codeincomplete.com/games/racer/v4-final/)
This period is divided into 10 one-minute experiments. The game is continuous in this 10 minutes but every minute is considered as a separate experiment. In the first experiment, users will not hear any music. In all following experiments, there is music in the background. 9 experiments with music are divided into 3 main parts. Users hear 3 different pieces of music during the game:
* Music with no lyrics
* Music with familiar lyrics ( for all users familiar lyrics is in their mother tongue, to make sure user has no difficulty to understand lyrics)
* Music with unfamiliar lyrics (in all experiments unfamiliar music is in Russian. Users should not know Russian)
There are 2 main rules about the order of pieces of music in these 9 experiments:
1. Pieces of music' order should be chosen randomly
1. first music of a part should not be as same as last music of previous part.(to make sure all 3 pieces of music have similar conditions)
The qualification of users' driving is based on the number of their accidents in each experiment.
screen should be recorded during game. interviewers are not going to count number of accidents simultaneously to not distract users. After completion of test, number of accidents will be counted for each experiment using recorded video. 
Users should not be given extra information about test and experiment. 
There is just one instruction for them:
**Drive as far as you can.**

2. After completion of 10 experiments, users are asked to give their feedback about musics they have heard and fill demographic information form on following address:
[Interview form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdH6oF8i3I88bzX3GSmSZELtyDPi_HG-7wPMWCQNd7Omjugyw/viewform?usp=sf_link)

3. Users should fill Music background test which is provided on previous form.

4. Users are wanted to fill personality test on following website:
[Personality test](https://discovermyprofile.com/miniIPIP/introduction.html)






# Basic statistics on gathered data
6 persons were interviewed for pilot. After consulting with TAs changes to pilot was applied and main interviews started. 4 interviews has been done so far.



# Initial Analysis

Number of accidents during pilot:(each line demonstrate one user, x-axis shows experiments, y-axis is number of accidents)

Number of accidents in different modalities by native tongue:
![](https://github.com/ypyelab/hello-world/blob/master/LanguagevsFamiliarity-001.jpg)

One result of interest is to see whether the number of accidents that participants had while listening karaoke songs, depends whether the participant is French, Persian or Spanish native speaker. The mean of accidents has similar results for the three groups, being respectively 4.17, 4 and 4. 

Nonetheless, the number of accidents that participants had while listening familiar and foreign songs, seems to depend whether the participant is French, Persian or Spanish native speaker. The mean number of accidents while listening to familiar songs is respectively 3.67, 7.33, 6.33. The mean number of accidents while listening to foreign songs is respectively 4.50, 6.67, 3.67.

The second step is to identify if this difference of means is statistically significant in the three groups. With this purpose, Kruskal-Wallis tests are performed. 

With a chi-squared of 0, and a p-value of 1, there is evidence to say that the number of accidents that participants had while listening karaoke songs is statistically the same whether the participant is French, Persian or Spanish native speaker.

With a chi-squared of 2.7, and a p-value of 0.2592, there is evidence to say that the number of accidents that participants had while listening to familiar songs is statistically the same whether the participant is French, Persian or Spanish native speaker.

With a chi-squared of 2.25, and a p-value of 0.3247, there is evidence to say that the number of accidents that participants had while listening to foreign songs is statistically the same whether the participant is French, Persian or Spanish native speaker.

## Overall feedback about experiment




## Personality
### Openness
* mean: 54.75
* std: 19.88928

### Conscientiousness
* mean: 73.5
* std: 24.25558

### Extroversion
* mean: 78.75
* std: 8.958236

### Agreeableness
* mean: 65.75
* std: 16.17354

### Neuroticism
* mean: 54.75
* std: 23.68368

Conscientiousness, extraversion, and agreeableness had a high correlation (more than 0.7 in absolute value) with the total number of accidents. If with more data the level of correlation holds, a linear regression that includes these features would be proposed.

# Arising Difficulties
First of all, an experiment was needed that makes the user react to certain events. Finding such a game was not easy as it would need to be a game that is continuously similar to reduce the bias that certain sections of the game have a different impact to the user’s reaction than others and therefore, it would not be the music affecting the user’s reaction but the game itself. It was decided that a car racing game would give this “stability” within the game as it would simply be following the street.
The next difficulty was to find a measurement for reaction. First step was to find a car game where reaction time could be measured. The ideal game would be a car racing game where “things” would pop up unexpectedly and the user would have to avoid that hurdle. If the user runs into it, then it would measured how many times the user has ran into it within a musical piece. Unfortunately, no such perfect game was found. However, a racing game that has consistent tracks, simple navigation of the car “up left right” was found. The reaction time would be the number of times the car would ram into another car.
The difficulty of that game was that it was not possible to play the game in full screen - so the game had to be within a smaller window of the screen. However, given that all users have the same interface, it should not affect any biases, except for those who don’t have their glasses on and can’t see the game very well. 
Finding similar musical pieces was not easy, either. Especially since musical pieces from three different cultures are being used - Persian, Latin (Spanish), French, and Russian. While it was not hard to find similar pieces in Spanish and French, there was more difficulty finding Persian songs that were similar to the ones of the western world. Songs were filtered by the following website: http://www.songkeybpm.com/Advanced. The website allowed to add specific keys - C minor was chosen - and a specific BPM, which ranged between 130 and 145. This allowed to find the appropriate songs that at least are in the right key and similar BPM. The gender of the singer needed to be male. The only problem arose when even songs in the same key and BPM did not sound similar to each other. Therefore of the five songs for each language with only male singers, one was for each was chosen by making sure they sound similar to each other (similar musical genre, Pop/Rock was chosen, similar beat, and instruments that were more generic). With the song without lyrics, a regular song that is similar to the others was chosen, that was not known, and then its karaoke version was taken.

The next difficulties arose during the actual game. It was noticed that there were certain sections of the game where not much cars would block the user’s view and hence, for at least 10 seconds, the user would have free drive and no potential accidents could be recorded. It was quite worrisome that those might affect the results. However, given that the game is 10 minutes long, and given that the musical pieces are randomized, those two to three 10 seconds “non-accidental” drives would be normalized throughout the game. 
The other question that arose is to ask within the group is: “What to tell the user how to drive?” The users need to drive in a way so they have to focus on the driving as opposed to just free drive and not care about anything. If they just freely drive, don’t care about any obstacles, then the music would not really affect their attitude towards the game. They needed to be given a certain task during the game, so the user would need to focus on that task. One thought was to tell the user to drive as if they would be driving in real life. However, that proved to be quite bad for our experiment as users would simply drive very slowly to avoid any accidents with any cars. I have had one user who only had three accidents during the entire 10 minutes drive, but he would also drive way below the speed limit of the other racing cars. Another option was to tell them that they needed to drive at least 70MPH and again drive as if they would drive in real life. Another thought was that increasing the speed limit would prompt the users to make more accidents even though they would focus on avoiding them. Ultimately, it was decided to simply tell the users that this is a car racing game and that they should have the fastest time per each lap. This way, the user if is focused on going at high speed limit and at the same time avoid accidents that might slow the user down. 

Finally, the counting of accidents was not automatic - as in, there wasn’t a system that systematically captured each accident and recorded the accident to the specific test phase. This proved to be impossible to implement. So there were two options:

1. Observer sits next to the user and counts the accidents quietly and write them down after each test phase.
2. Observer records the entire screen of the user’s driving and then count the accidents after the user has completed the experiment. 

Option 2 was the better of the two, because sitting next to the user and writing things down might distract the user and potentially bias the user as he or she would notice that the observer is counting the accidents and therefore adjust his or her driving behavior. Recording was the simplest way, even though more manual. By recording the user’s game, the user would not be distracted by the observers actions since it would just observe the user driving without writing anything down, and at the end, observer could go over the recording and count the accidents. 
# Interesting Problems
 It was observed that as the user got experience in driving on the race track and given that the race track repeated itself after each lap, the accidents considerably decreased towards the end of the 10 minute race. The users became more confident with the logistics on how to handle the game and are familiar with the track. Therefore, the number of accidents decreased considerably towards the end - despite the fact that with increased confidence did also increase the speed. The group does not think this is a big deal as, again, it would be normalized to the three test phases (no lyrics, mother tongue, foreign language). Given that the songs are allocated randomly, it was still possible to track if the different test phases affect the reaction time. Users usually drive faster as they gain confidence, so while the accidents decrease, they do not go to zero. However, not all users got better towards the end. There were also users who remained at a similar level of accidents throughout the game. It would be interesting to analyze what personality type of people became better at the game towards the end and what did not.
